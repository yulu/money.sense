subtitle: |
  A personal blog talking about money philosophy and lifestyle.
content : |
 This blog started as a personal mission—to improve my financial literacy, build better money habits, and create lasting financial security for my family. Along the way, I realized that even in a wealthy society like Singapore, clear and trustworthy financial service is still lacking. I don’t claim to be an expert. I’m learning through real experiences, mistakes, and continuous improvement. Here, I share honest lessons and practical insights on investing, money, and wealth—so you can think more clearly, avoid common pitfalls, and take control of your financial future.
