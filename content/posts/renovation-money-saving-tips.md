## Money-Saving Tip 1: Buying Designer Lighting from an Italian Furniture Store Overseas

![](https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/littlecheesecake.me/blog-post/renovation-money-saving-tips/home-reno-light.excalidraw.png)

During my new home renovation, I fell in love with the PH5 pendant light after seeing it in person at a local home store. It looked even better in real life — I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

The problem? Ordering locally meant waiting three months, and the price was pretty steep.

At the time, an interior designer had recommended an overseas website that had it in stock. When he first sent me the link, there was a discount. But of course… by the time I checked again, the sale was over and it was back to full price. 🥲

Then I remembered an Italian online store called mohd, where I had previously bought another lamp. When I contacted them before, I noticed they were using our company’s customer service software — which honestly made me trust them more. A design-focused store with good systems? I’m in. 😂

The color I wanted wasn’t listed on their website, so I messaged customer service just to ask. To my surprise, they could special order it. And the quote they gave me was more than SGD 800 cheaper than other options I had seen. Even after adding shipping and taxes, it still worked out to over SGD 500 cheaper than buying locally — and the wait time was only about one month.

I had almost given up on the lamp, but suddenly it felt like I _had_ to grab this deal.

We went back and forth over email for about 4–5 days. The Italian team’s English wasn’t perfect, so it took a few rounds to clarify everything. Even the payment needed a couple of tries before it went through successfully.

But overall, the experience was solid.

Why I felt comfortable ordering:

- MOHD is a well-known Italian designer furniture e-commerce site. I contacted them through the professional customer service system on their website and received replies through the same official channel.
- They provided a formal quotation with company details and official stamp.
- Payment was made via official PayPal.

Looking back, it was definitely worth the extra effort. If you’re renovating and eyeing designer pieces, it might be worth checking overseas retailers — sometimes the savings are surprisingly significant.

## Money-Saving Tip 2: Hacking into the Supply Chain, Solid Wood Shutters from Taobao

This was another "renovation adventure".

I really liked the look of solid wood shutters — the kind that feels clean, timeless, and a little bit niche. I told my interior designer that I wanted this style for the windows. He immediately warned me: That’s going to be expensive. Why not just do regular blinds instead?

But once the idea was planted… I couldn’t let it go.

First, I contacted a local supplier. The quote came back at over **SGD 6,000+** and the lead time is 3 months, that instantly talked me out of it.

Later, I asked a local home decor blogger on social media for recommendations. She suggested a shop. After contacting them, I realized it was the same supplier as before.

Then while browsing their promotional posts, I noticed something interesting — some hints that the local supplier was actually ordering custom pieces from manufacturers in China.

So I followed the trail and searched on Taobao myself.

I found a few factories. Two of them weren’t very responsive (I suspect they already had overseas distribution partners and weren’t keen on direct orders). But one factory had an incredibly helpful customer service rep — they were even replying during Chinese New Year and sent me sample pieces.

### Price comparison

- Design + production: **RMB 7,000+**
- Sea freight: **RMB 2,000+**
- Local installation: **SGD 200**

Even after conversion, it worked out to roughly 2000 SGD, one-third of the local quote.

### Time comparison

- Production: 3 weeks
- Sea freight: 3 weeks
- Installation scheduling: 1 week

Overall timeline? Still reasonable. Around 2 months, less than the 3 month lead time the local provider promised. 

From both a cost and total time perspective, DIY sourcing clearly had the advantage. Of course, the risk is all on you. If your measurements are wrong and it doesn’t fit, that’s it — game over. No one to blame. But at one-third of the price? The temptation was too strong. So I decided to do it.

### The Process (aka Stress Level Rising 📈)

First step: measure everything myself.

My first round of measurements was a bit rough. Plus, the bay window had slight curves. The factory designer reminded me: If the measurements aren’t precise, it might not fit.

That definitely woke me up.

I went back to the site multiple times to re-measure carefully. After several rounds of communication with the designer, we finalized the style and installation method. They produced technical drawings. I confirmed. Order placed.

Then came the waiting.

Two to three weeks for production.  

Another two to three weeks for sea shipping.

Finally, the shipment arrived.

Except… some components were missing.

To their credit, the factory was very responsible. Early in the morning, we got on a video call and checked every single piece together. Eventually we discovered one package had been left behind at the warehouse because the staff forgot to send me the tracking number.

So… more waiting.

Eventually, a massive three-meter-long package arrived. The local delivery team couldn’t fit it into the lift and left it downstairs. I mentally prepared myself to carry a long wooden beam up the stairs. But after opening the packaging, I realized the longest piece could just barely fit diagonally into the lift. I have never felt so relieved.

I hired a local curtain installer to handle the final setup. And when it went in — it fit perfectly.

That moment? Very satisfying.

### Minor issues (because no project is perfect):

- The left and right window panels weren’t perfectly symmetrical, so alignment with the beam wasn’t 100%.
- A few slats had minor bumps from shipping — not very noticeable unless you look closely.

But honestly, after months of waiting and coordinating, the fact that it fit and worked was already a huge win.

DIY sourcing during renovation isn’t for everyone. You need patience, time, and tolerance for risk. But if you’re willing to manage the process yourself, the cost difference can be substantial. And sometimes… the stress makes the final result even sweeter.
