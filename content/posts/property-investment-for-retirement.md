In 2021, DBS published a report that used detailed data and rigorous assumptions to analyze some of the reasons behind the slowdown in real estate investment returns. The report concluded with the viewpoint that investing in Singapore real estate yields lower returns compared to investing in the S&P 500 or REITs:

1. Property along may not be enough
2. Changing demographics changing demand for homes
3. Increase in property prices outpacing salary growthï¼Ÿ
4. Demographics facing challenges in housing and affordability and retirement goals
5. High acquisition costs make property a less attractive investment asset class

<p>

I have to say that this report is definitely worth reading. (The original report is not easy to find for download, but you can refer to an analysis [article by InvestmentMoats](https://investmentmoats.com/money/dbs-future-property-investment-strategy/)). The following comparison chart of return curves is very well-made and serves as a valuable reference:

</div>

However, following DBSâ€™s 2021 report, Singaporeâ€™s real estate market experienced a significant upward trend. The Singapore Property Index (SPI) saw an increase of nearly 25%, while S-REITs remained sluggish due to the high-interest-rate environment. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 went through volatility in 2022, and the Straits Times Index (STI) performed well, driven by Singaporeâ€™s strong economic growth.  

If the return curve in the report were extended to 2024, we might see the gap between returns on the first property investment and the S&P 500 narrow, possibly even surpassing S-REITs. DBSâ€™s report analyzed data from around 2009 to early 2021, a period when the S&P 500 experienced a historic bull market, while Singaporeâ€™s property prices were constrained by low interest rates and government cooling measures.  

To provide an alternative perspective on real estate investment, I will analyze a specific case study to calculate the expected returns of investing in Singapore property and compare them to financial product investments. Before diving into the case study, I will first outline relevant financial concepts and mathematical formulas, then gather historical data to support the calculations, and finally use a Python script to compute the projected returns based on various assumptions.

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts


### SORA - Singapore Overnight Rate Average

> [!tip] SORA - Singapore Overnight Rate Average
> SORA - Singapore Overnight Rate Average is the benchmark interest rate used in Singapore's financial markets. It represents the **volume-weighted average rate** of unsecured overnight interbank SGD transactions. (Since 2021, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate - SIBOR and Swap Offer Rate - SOR have been phased out, making SORA the primary interest rate benchmark in Singapore)

SORA directly influences **floating-rate home loans** in Singapore. Many banks have adopted **SORA-pegged mortgage rates** to determine loan interest payments. Here how it works:

- Floating-Rate Mortgage Linked to SORA

$$
\text{Mortgage Rate} = \text{SORA(e.g. 3M SORA)} + \text{Bank's Fixed Spread}
$$

The **bank's fixed spread** typically ranges between **0.65% to 1.00% per annum**

- Fixed-Rate Mortgage

Fixed-rate mortgages are not directly affected by SORA in the short term, however banks consider SORA trends when pricing new fixed-rate packages.

We can reference to SORA to estimate the loan interest rate for our property investment. 

### SPI - Singapore Property Index

>[!tip] SPI - Singapore Property Index
> The SPI is a real estate market indicator that tracks the price movements of private residential and HDB properties in Singapore. It provides insights into property price trends, helping buyers, investors, and policymakers make informed decisions.

There are different versions of the SPI, depending on the data source
- URA Private Residential Property Index (PPI)
	- Tracks private condominium, apartment and landed property price changes
	- Updated quarterly by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)
	- Used by investors to gauge private housing market trends
- HDB Resale Price Index (RPI)
	- Tracks the resale prices of HDB flats
	- Published by HDB every quarter
	- Important for homebuyers considering public housing investments
- SRX Singapore Property Index
	- Published by SRX Property (a real estate data provider)
	- Tracks both private and public property price movements
	- Uses proprietary transaction data and market analytics

We can refer to the SPI to estimate the rate of return and calculate the property investment return based on property value appreciation.

### Rental Yield

> [!tip] Rental Yield
> Rental yield is a measure of the return on investment (ROI) from a rental property, expressed as a percentage of the property's value. It helps investors assess the profitability of a real estate investment.

There are two common types of rental yield
- Gross Rental Yield -  calculated before accounting for expenses (such as property taxes, maintenance, and mortgage payments). It provides a simple percentage return based on the property's purchase price. Formula for Gross Rental Yield:

$$
\text{Gross Rental Yield} = (\frac{\text{Annual Rental Income}}{\text{Property Value}}) \times 100
$$

- Net Rental Yield - the net rental yield considers operating costs such property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and management fees. This provides a more accurate reflection of the investor's actual return. Formula for Net Rental Yield:

$$
\text{Net Rental Yield} = (\frac{\text{Annual Rental Income} - \text{Annuual Expenses}}{\text{Property Value}}) \times 100
$$

We can refer to rental yield to:
- Assist with mortgage planning â€“ if the rental yield covers loan repayments, the property may be self-sustaining.
- Estimate the passive income (similar to dividend yield) generated by the property investment.


### Property Value Appreciation (Future Value)

> [!tip] Property Value Appreciation
> Property value appreciation refers to the increase in the market value of a property over time. It is a key factor for real estate investors and homeowners, as it impacts the potential return on investment (ROI) when selling a property

Property appreciation can be calculated using the compound interest formula:

$$
\begin{align}
& FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \newline
& where: \newline
& \text{FV = Feature value} \newline
& \text{PV = Present value} \newline
& \text{r = Annual (Monthly) Interest Rate} \newline
& \text{n = Total number of years (months)} \newline
\end{align}
$$

We can use the Future Value formula to calculate the property value by providing an interest rate (referencing the SPI) and the investment tenure.

### EMI - Equated Monthly Instalment

> [!tip] EMI - Equated Monthly Instalment
> EMI is the fixed monthly payment that a borrower makes to repay a loan over a specified period. It consists of two components:
> 1. Principal Repayment - The portion of the payment that goes toward reducing the loan amount.
> 2. Interest Payment - The portion of the payment that covers the interest on the outstanding loan balance.
 
 The EMI for a loan is calculated using the formula:

 $$
\begin{align}
& EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \newline
& where: \newline
& \text{P = Loan amount (Principal)} \newline
& \text{r = Monthly interest rate (Annual Interest Rate / 12)} \newline
& \text{n = Total number of months (Loan Tenure} \times \text{12)} \newline
\end{align}
$$

We can use the EMI formula to calculate the required monthly mortgage payment. Conversely, given an expected EMI, we can determine the loan amount:

$$
\begin{align}
& P = EMI \times (\frac{(1 - (1 + r)^\frac{1}{n})}{r}) \newline
& where: \newline
& \text{EMI = Equated Monthly Instalment)} \newline
& \text{r = Monthly interest rate (Annual Interest Rate / 12)} \newline
& \text{n = Total number of months (Loan Tenure} \times \text{12)} \newline
\end{align}
$$

SORA Trends:
- 1-Month Compound SORA:
	- Historical Average: ~1.05%
	- Recent Value: 2.77%
- 3-Month Compound SORA:
	- Historical Average: ~1.05%
	- Recent Value: 2.88%

Estimated mortgage rates are based on the 3-Month Compound SORA plus a typical bank spread of **0.8%** to **1.5%**, resulting in a range of **1.85%** to **2.85%**. For further calculations, an average rate of **2.5%** is chosen.

### SPI - Property Value Appreciation in Singapore

</div>

#### Volatility

The annualized volatility of the "Whole Island" non-landed private residential property price index is approximately **6.59%**. Historically, the S&P 500 has exhibited an average annualized volatility ranging between 15% and 20%. This is significantly higher than the approximately 6.59% annualized volatility observed in the Singapore "Whole Island" property price index. The lower volatility in the property market can be attributed to its illiquid nature, less frequent transactions, and different market dynamics compared to the highly liquid and reactive equity markets.

#### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

From the 1975-2024 SPI data, we can calculate the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) using:

$$
\begin{align}
& \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Value}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \newline
& \text{Where:} \newline
& \text{Final Value = Latest SPI value (2024)} \newline
& \text{Initial Value = SPI value from 1975} \newline
& \text{n = Number of years} \newline
\end{align}
$$


The estimated annualized growth rate (CAGR) for the Singapore Property Index (SPI) from 1975 to 2024 is approximately **6.14%** per year. Meanwhile, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the Non-Landed Property Price Index over the past 20 years is approximately **4.69%** per year. Compared to stocks (**~7-10%** CAGR) and bonds (**~2-4%** CAGR), property offers moderate growth with lower volatility.  

Additionally, we observe that investment gains from property tend to decline over time. Factors such as rising interest rates, economic conditions, and government policies influence property investment returns. These numbers can serve as a reference for estimating long-term property price appreciation. A **4.69%** CAGR suggests that property investment remains a solid long-term hedge against inflation.  

It is important to note that the volatility and price appreciation rate are derived from historical average data. However, real estate investment requires property selection, much like stock picking, making the actual risk and return less predictable.

### Rental Yields in Singapore

<div>
    <span class="image fit" style="max-width: 800px;"><img src="https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/littlecheesecake.me/money.sense/property_investment_for_retirement/rental_yield_2004-2024.png" alt="" /></span>
</div>

The historical data for rental yields is not easily accessible online. To estimate a rough figure, the strategy used is to calculate the URA Rental Index (Base Quarter 2009-Q1 = 100) to URA Price Index (Base Quarter 2009-Q1 = 100) ratio and scale it to 2009 data. From this [website](https://www.squarefoot.com.sg/market-watch/rental-yield), we can reference the 2009 rental yield at **4.8%**, so we can scale the ratio with **4.8%** to obtain a rough estimation of rental yield trends.  

The average rental yield from 2004 to 2024 is **3.8%**, which can be used as a reference for further calculations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Back-of-envelop Calculation with an Example

In this section, let me perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate how much should be invested in the property and what the expected return would be, based on the following assumptions.

> [!note] Assumptions
> 
> - A 20-year investment horizon is considered.
> - The property investment value ranges between 1.2 million to 1.6 million SGD.
> - Rental income covers expenses, meaning it does not impact my existing cash flow.


### Upfront Costs for Property Purchase (as the First property)

Here, we only consider the first property as an investment property, as investing in a second property incurs significantly higher costs due to ABSD. A first property investment is still achievable for a family if the couple can afford one property each, allowing one to be for owner-occupation and the other for investment.  

In addition to the down payment (which will be calculated later), additional upfront costs include BSD plus legal and administrative fees (around $4000).

| Cost Breakdown          | Description   | Amount  |
| ----------------------- | --------------| ------- |
| Stamp Duties            | Taxes levied on property transactions                                                | First **$180,000**: **1%**<br>Next **$180,000**: **2%**<br>Next **$640,000**: **3%**<br>Next **$500,000**: **4%**<br>Next **$1,500,000**: **5%**<br>Remaining amount: **6%** <br><br>As of Feb 2025, refer to the [Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/stamp-duty/for-property/buying-or-acquiring-property/buyer's-stamp-duty-(bsd))|
| Legal Fees              | Covers the cost of legal services for conveyancing and other related matters.        | $2,500 to $3,000  |
| Property Valuation Fees | Assesses the market value of the property, often required by banks for loan approval | $500 to $1,000  |
| Agent Commissions       | Agent commission for property purchase                                               | 0, agent commission for condo is normally borne by Seller.  |
| Miscellaneous Costs     | One time renovation and maintenance                                                  | 0, could be ignored and considered as operational cost  |


### Operational Costs

To maintain the rental property, there is a significant amount of operational costs, which reduces the investment returns. We will calculate these costs below.

| Cost Breakdown   | Description  | Amount    |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Property Taxes                    | Property taxes in Singapore are calculated based on the Annual Value (AV) of the property, which is the estimated annual rental income if the property were rented out, regardless of whether it is occupied or vacant. The tax rates differ for owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied properties                | First **$30,000**: **12%**<br>Next **$15,000**: **20%**<br>Next **$15,000**: **28%**<br>Above **$60,000**: **36%**<br><br>As of Feb 2025, refer to the [Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/property-tax/property-owners/property-tax-rates) |
| Management Costs                  | Regular maintenance ensures the property remains in good condition and attractive to tenants. Costs can vary based on the property's age, type, and location. For a condo, monthly maintenance fees are payable to the Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) for the upkeep of common areas and facilities. | These fees can range from **$200 to $500** or more, depending on the condominium's facilities and location. Estimated as 350 |
| Repairs and Renovations           | Over time, wear and tear will necessitate repairs or renovations to maintain the property's appeal and functionality. It's prudent to set aside a budget for such expenses, which can vary widely based on the property's condition and the extent of work required.                                             | Estimate 0.5% of property price annually |
| Insurance                         | Landlord insurance policies can protect against potential risks such as property damage, loss of rental income, and liability claims. Premiums vary based on coverage levels but are a worthwhile consideration for safeguarding your investment.                                                                | Estimated as $150 annually |
| Agent Commissions                 | If you use a real estate agent to secure tenants, a common practice in Singapore is for the landlord to pay the agent a commission equivalent to half a month's rent for a one-year lease or one month's rent for a two-year lease.                                                                              | Normally half-month rent for a 1-year lease|
| Utilities and Miscellaneous Costs | While tenants typically cover utilities, there may be instances where the landlord bears these costs, especially during vacancy periods. Additionally, other miscellaneous expenses, such as advertising for tenants or legal fees for lease agreements, should be considered.                                   | Estimate 5% of rental |

Taking a property value at **$1.2M**, we can estimate the operational cost per month at **$1,420**, rental income at **$3,800**.

### Total Investment Amount

Assuming that we do not want the property investment to impact our existing cash flow, we aim for the rental income to fully cover the monthly loan payment and operational costs. Based on this, we can calculate the maximum loan amount we can afford and the total upfront cost of the purchase.  For a **$1.2M** property with a 20-year mortgage tenure:
- Loan amount: **$449,138**
- Total upfront investment amount: **$799,461**

```python
# Helper function to calculate the maximum loan amount
def calculate_loan_amount(emi, r, n):
    return emi * ((1 - (1 + r) ** -n) / r)


# Helper function to calculate the down payment if expect to rental to cover monthly mortgage and ops cost
def calculate_down_payment(property_value, monthly_rental_income, ops_cost):
    legal_fee = 3000
    valuation_fee = 1000
    
    emi = monthly_rental_income - ops_cost
    
    max_loan_amount = calculate_loan_amount(emi, interest_rate / 12, loan_tenure_years * 12)

    bsd_amount = calculate_bsd(property_price)
    
    # Required down payment
    required_down_payment = property_value - max_loan_amount
    total_upfront  = required_down_payment + bsd_amount + legal_fee + valuation_fee
    
    return (int(max_loan_amount), int(total_upfront))


result = calculate_down_payment(1_200_200, 3_800, 1_420)
print('loan amount:', result[0])

### Value Appreciation

We can use the simple future value formula and the SPI CGAR to estimate the price appreciation of the invested property over the investment tenure. Based on historical data, a **$1.2M** property in Singapore could potentially appreciate to around **$2.9M** over the next **20 years**. However, it's essential to consider the inherent uncertainties and conduct thorough research or consult with property investment professionals before making decisions.

Apply the above calculations to a range of property value from **$1.2M** to **$1.6M**, we can have the data below. 

| property value | upfront payment | monthly loan amount | monthly rental income | price appreciation |

### How about I invest the amount in stock market?

If the upfront payment were invested in the stock market instead, we could expect the total investment amount to grow at annual return rates of 6%, 7%, and 8%, as shown below. With an approximate 7% annual growth rate, stock market investments are expected to perform slightly better than property appreciation.

## ðŸŒ± Should I invest in Singapore property?

I would still consider property investment as a possibility. There are indeed pros and cons to property investment:  

**Pros**  
- It diversifies investments beyond equity and bonds.  
- It is less volatile compared to equity investments.  
- It provides a safer way to use leverage in investment compared to stocks.  
- It offers an additional passive income stream during retirement.  

**Cons**  
- Investing in a single property carries higher concentration risk compared to broad index funds.  
- It involves non-financial operational costs, such as managing tenant relationships and adapting to government policy changes.  
- Property value may depreciate with time

I prioritize investments in the stock and bond markets due to their flexibility, controllable risks, and ease of operation. However, I still consider Singapore property investment as a potential way to diversify my family's investment portfolio. To minimize the high investment cost from ABSD, we would need to invest as a family. When our investment assets reach a certain level and the market presents good opportunities, we could consider property investment for risk diversification and additional retirement income. In this money story, I shared our [home purchase strategy](/posts/property-budgeting-buy-strategy/) and how we intentionally left the option open for future investment opportunities.
