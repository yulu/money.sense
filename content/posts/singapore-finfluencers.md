When it comes to learning about investing and personal finance, local Finfluencers can be a very practical resource. Compared to video content, I personally prefer blog/plog, which allow for more in-depth explanations. Over time, I’ve followed several bloggers/ploggers who are well worth recommending. Many of them openly share their own financial situations, including income, expenses, and portfolio allocations. This transparency and neutrality make their content especially persuasive. Of course, everyone has different investment styles and values, so it's important to approach any viewpoint with a critical mind.

### 🔥 sgfirecouple

[sgfirecouple](https://www.instagram.com/sgfirecouple) is an anonymous creator who mainly shares content on Instagram and 🍋. Here’s a bit of background: 34/35 years old, previously worked in tech sales (recently left the workforce), has two daughters, and was a cancer fighter. I started following him after coming across his candid sharing about his cancer journey. His content is refreshingly grounded, including detailed breakdowns of monthly income and expenses, portfolio allocations, and his overall financial philosophy.


#### ⛑️ sgfirecouple's famlity insurance strategy

His family insurance coverage is very comprehensive and represents a typical Singaporean family setup:  the whole family has private hospitalisation insurance; the adults have life, critical illness, accident, and savings insurance; and the children have life and critical illness insurance.

#### 📈 sgfirecouple's investment strategy

His investment strategy is very simple and serves as a good reference for beginners in personal finance: CPF is used as a risk-free, low-yield investment for a safety net; he invests in Singapore blue-chip stocks and US broad-based index ETFs, complemented by some high-quality individual stocks. In his latest update, his financial investment assets (including CPF but excluding property) have already exceeded 1 million.

### 🔥 SG Budget Babe

Dawn Cher has been running her blog, [SG Budget Babe](https://sgbudgetbabe.com/), since 2014 and has built a large and loyal following. As a female investor, she places strong emphasis on risk management and has written extensively on insurance — from early pitfalls with ILPs, to side-by-side comparisons of medical insurance plans, and in-depth analyses of high-end healthcare policies. Beyond investing, she also shares her personal life experiences, such as motherhood, home renovation, and planning for children’s education — making her content highly relatable and practical for many Singaporean families.

It’s worth noting that some of her content includes sponsored collaborations. While she discloses these partnerships and makes efforts to stay objective, naturally, any content tied to commercial interests may invite skepticism. Personally, I approach such posts with a bit more caution and prefer to cross-reference information from multiple sources.

#### ⛑️ SG Budget Babe's family insurance strategy

Her family insurance coverage is comprehensive: hospitalisation insurance, term life, and critical illness. For the children, it includes hospitalisation, accident, and critical illness insurance. In her latest update in 2025, she mentioned that she did not purchase whole life insurance for her children—which is a strategy I personally agree with. She and her husband have also enhanced CareShield Life and added home insurance—both of which I have also included in my own family insurance planning. For the elderly and children, she believes that the most important thing is to have coverage for medical treatment expenses.

#### 📈 SG Budget Babe's investment strategy

She believes in value investing: analyzing fundamentals and buying undervalued companies in the market for long-term holding. She has a relatively high risk tolerance and holds some cryptocurrency. In early 2025, she shared her latest investment milestone: reaching her goal of 1 million in investments (pure financial investments, excluding CPF and property). For a 35-year-old working mother of two with an average income (increased a lot over the years according to her transparent sharing), this is truly impressive.


### 🔥 Investment Moats

Kyith, the author behind [Investment Moats](https://investmentmoats.com/), is considered one of the pioneers in Singapore’s personal finance blogging scene. He’s been writing consistently since 2005 and has influenced many who came after him. Between 2004 and 2015, he worked as an IT operations engineer while maintaining his blog as a side project. Eventually, he transitioned into the financial industry and now works as a researcher at a financial advisory firm.

Kyith is particularly strong in analyzing investment topics through data and spreadsheets, and many of his articles feature detailed Excel calculations. For example, he once simulated how different investment portfolios would have performed 20 years after retiring in the early 2000s, illustrating the risks that high-volatility portfolios pose to passive income during market downturns. In recent years, as he approaches financial independence himself, he’s focused more on sustainability and long-term income planning. That said, some of his articles can be quite lengthy and technical, which may feel a bit heavy for casual readers.

#### ⛑️ Investment Moats's insurance strategy

His insurance planning strategy is quite interesting. He calculates the total premium needed to cover all his lifelong insurance needs (not just the annual premium, but the total cost calculated by multiplying the term of the insurance by the annual premium), and then adjusts and optimizes based on this amount. One of his approaches is particularly noteworthy: he has several term life policies in his insurance portfolio, but his actual life insurance needs are not that high. Instead, he uses term life policies with critical illness (CI) riders to meet his critical illness insurance needs, which is actually a very cost-effective solution.

#### 📈 Investment Moats's investment strategy

He builds his own diversified investment portfolio, simulating high-quality fund investment strategies to invest in individual stocks, which is relatively complex. The portfolio mainly focuses on SGD dividend stocks and US stocks.


### Personal Views

In the social media era, Finfluencer content isn’t always reliable. In recent years, complaints and regulatory scrutiny around Finfluencers have grown. When I filter content, I tend to watch out for a few red flags to avoid falling into potential traps:

- 🚫 Lack of transparency, particularly when there's a clear agenda to drive traffic or promote products
- 🚫 Strong personal bias that overshadows objective analysis
- 🚫 Financial philosophies that don’t resonate with me — such as over-focusing on short-term market fluctuations, excessive trading, or frequent promotion of complex derivative products
- 🚫 High repetition and limited depth in short-form video content
