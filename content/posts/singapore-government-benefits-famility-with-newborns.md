Assuming parents opt for public institutions and qualify for means-tested subsidies：

#### 🏥 Basic Hospitalisation Insurance

✅ Covered by MediSave top-ups

#### 👩🏼‍🍼 Basic Infant and Childcare Costs

- **Infant Care (5–18 months)**: $560–$10,444 total (after subsidy, $40–$746/month for 14 months)
- **Childcare (Preschool to K2)**: $162–$21,438 total (after subsidy, $3–$397/month over 4.5 years)
