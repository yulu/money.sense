#### 🏥 Basic Hospitalisation Insurance

Public A Ward IP Plan: ~$2,100 over 7 years (assuming $300/year premium, fully payable via CPF)

✅ Covered by MediSave top-ups

#### 👩🏼‍🍼 Basic Infant and Childcare Costs

Infant Care (5–18 months): $560–$10,444 total (after subsidy, $40–$746/month for 14 months)
