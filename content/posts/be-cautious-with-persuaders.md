Howard Marks has this passage in his book "The Most Important Thing," which I find very interesting:

> Brokerages want you to believe that everyone has the ability to invest - at the cost of paying $10 in commission for each transaction. Mutual fund companies, on the other hand, don't want you to believe in your own investment abilities; they want you to believe that only they possess such capabilities. Consequently, you will invest your money in actively managed funds and pay the associated high fees.
> 
> I consider those who simplify investment for others as "persuaders"...

His definition of persuaders gave me some inspiration. If we understand the business models of different institutions and the perspectives of "persuaders," we can make more objective and neutral financial decisions:

- Brokerages: Pursuing excess returns (alpha) in the market is a zero-sum game, largely dominated by institutional investors. Individual traders make very little consistent profit and require a lot of effort.
- Mutual Funds: Most actively managed funds can't outperform the market.
- Insurance: Insurance investment products are essentially fund wrappers with high costs.
- Banks: Various operations, such as showing funds to increase loan limits, credit card rebates, etc., all stimulate you to increase borrowing.

In the book "Three-Body Problem", there is a term called "dimensional reduction strike." Here, once we understand the business models of different institutions and their dimensions in the market, we can stand at a higher dimension and look down:

1. Improve your financial literacy and recognize the "persuaders."
2. Banks: Save money. If you have a high borrowing limit and find it difficult to save money, the first step is to budget and cultivate good spending habits. Cut off credit cards, ensure a surplus every month, and when you have enough emergency funds in your bank account, and can repay loans on time with a surplus each month, then consider so-called investment that makes money.
3. Insurance: When purchasing insurance, don't blindly judge whether it's "worth it" by comparing protection-type and investment-type insurance products. Compare investment-type insurance products with other investment products like mutual funds to have a basis for comparison.
4. Mutual Funds: Economic principles and historical data tell us that passive broad index funds are low-cost, low-maintenance investment targets that guarantee beta returns.
5. Brokerages: As long as you don't trade frequently or borrow, the investment cost on brokerage platforms is actually the lowest. Choose a reliable brokerage, invest in passive index funds through regular investment, and diversify your stock and bond investments to guarantee beta returns at the lowest cost.

Only when you have established financial knowledge and accumulated sufficient wealth do I think it's worth exploring:

1. Let others help you manage your money: only when you have established basic financial knowledge and judgment is it worth entrusting your finances to financial advisors, private banks, etc.
2. Challenge yourself for higher returns with higher risks: invest a small portion of your capital in high-risk investments, try high-risk investment products and strategies.
3. Wealth inheritance: plan for significant wealth through insurance products.

Never putting the cart before the horse!
