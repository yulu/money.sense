A few years ago, I came across this book on WeChat Reading called "[Worth It: Your Life, Your Money, Your Terms](https://www.amazon.sg/Worth-Your-Life-Money-Terms/dp/150114099X)." Out of curiosity, I flipped through it and found it worth reading. At the time, I was learning about investment and financial planning, and this book served as a simple and insightful guide. The author discusses the right financial mindset from a female perspective. Through reading, I learned about two concepts: "Money Blindness" and "Investment Fear." It resonated with me as I realized that these are common issues women tend to avoid. The following quote struck me:

> Being angry, confused, or distant about your financial situation will only lead to more problems than facing it head-on.

## Money Blindness and Money Aversion

In societal stereotypes, women are often considered to have lesser investment abilities compared to men. Two common reasons are risk aversion and lower numerical sensitivity among women. However, these factors aren't necessarily disadvantages. Risk aversion can help avoid excessive risk-taking and potential losses associated with high-risk investments. Moreover, strong savings and investment habits don't require advanced mathematical skills.

I've personally experienced both "Money Blindness" and "Money Aversion." 

I once had accumulated a few hundred dollars in credit card debt, and I chose to ignore it for several years, even though I had the means to repay it. For some reason, I had a psychological aversion to facing this problem head-on, which created a vicious cycle. Ignoring my finances led to not knowing where my money was going and hindered my ability to plan and save.

Regarding "Money Aversion," when I was younger, I believed discussing money was vulgar and associated it with negative traits like greed or materialism. I thought being assertive about money was a negative trait for women. I later realized how wrong this perception was. Money can also be linked to positive qualities like frugality, generosity, and freedom. Taking an objective and rational approach to money is the first step towards financial planning.

So, I started reflecting on my own money story and became unreserved about discussing money topics. I began tracking my expenses, creating household budgets, calculating my net worth, learning basic investment knowledge, and developing healthy savings and investment habits. I'm still learning, and this year, I've gained a deep understanding of insurance, which I should have explored earlier due to some harsh realities.

## Practical Recommendations

While this book is based on the American context, several recommendations and practices are universally applicable. Here are a few practical recommendations:

### Understand your attitude towards money and analyze your investor type

After understanding your attitude towards money, you can change some poor money habits and choose suitable investment methods.

### Experiment with restraining excessive consumption

The book suggests some experiments to control excessive spending:
- Clear an unnecessary subscription from your credit card.
- Recall actual expenses from the past three days.
- Plan a zero-spending action for the weekend.

The book also recommends good credit card habits, which are worth considering.
