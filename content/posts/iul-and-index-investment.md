Let‚Äôs get this out of the way ‚Äî I‚Äôm not directly comparing IUL (Indexed Universal Life Insurance) here, because as an insurance product, IUL has its own unique purposes: legacy planning, tax advantages, asset protection, and so on. These features make it difficult to draw a fair comparison with pure investment strategies.

Instead, what I‚Äôm comparing here is just the investment logic behind downside-protected strategies.

### ‚òÇÔ∏è Investment Logic Behind Floors and Caps

The floor-and-cap model used in IUL mirrors a downside-protected portfolio. Here's how that‚Äôs defined:

‚ùù Downside protection refers to techniques used in investing to mitigate or prevent a decline in asset value. Common tools include stop-loss orders, options contracts, and other hedging instruments designed to limit losses in individual positions or portfolios. ‚ùû

In short, these strategies seek to provide a safety net ‚Äî limiting downside risk, but often capping upside potential.


### ‚úçüèª Historical Backtesting (Excluding Fees)

Let‚Äôs look at three basic investment strategies (fee-free for simplicity):

‚ù∂ Downside-protected strategy: 0% floor and 9% cap (data based on available option pricing ‚Äî see below)

‚ù∑ Direct investment in the index: Riding full market volatility

‚ù∏ Low-volatility alternative: A 40/60 stock-bond portfolio, assuming a fixed 4% bond yield

I ran a backtest comparing both lump-sum investing and dollar-cost averaging (DCA) over a 25-year period using S&P 500 index data. See Figures 3, 4, and 5 for detailed outcomes.

(Note: This comparison does not include fees. Downside-protected portfolios generally involve options or structured derivatives and would logically have higher fees than passive index funds.)

### üí≠ Key Takeaways

The basic principle still holds: higher returns usually come with higher volatility. If you want to avoid market risk, you're likely giving up part of the potential upside.

For lump-sum investors, downside-protected portfolios can offer real advantages during turbulent markets. They reduce volatility and ensure no capital loss ‚Äî which can make sense for those with short time horizons or near-term liquidity needs.

For DCA investors, however, these strategies lose their shine. When the market dips, DCA lets you buy at lower prices ‚Äî something a downside-protected portfolio can‚Äôt capitalize on due to its capped upside. In this case, volatility isn‚Äôt necessarily bad. These portfolios often exhibit similar volatility to the index itself, and even more than a balanced stock-bond portfolio ‚Äî but with significantly lower long-term returns.

Looking at rolling one-year returns of the S&P 500, the most frequent annual return range is 10% to 20% ‚Äî already above the annual return cap in most downside-protected ETFs or strategies. The opportunity cost of that cap is significant, and compounded over time, it becomes hard to ignore. Missing out on just 5‚Äì10% annually can lead to 27% to 61% less in total returns over just five years.
