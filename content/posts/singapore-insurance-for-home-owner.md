What kind of insurance protection do you need after buying a house? Which insurances are mandatory, and which are optional? Here’s a summary. 

### 🔥 Fire Insurance: The “Firewall” for Your Home’s Structure

For HDB flats, purchasing HDB fire insurance is mandatory. This type of insurance mainly covers the internal structure of the house, fixed installations, and areas provided and built by HDB. If a fire occurs, the insurance will pay for the repair of these parts.

For condominiums or private residences managed by a Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST), the management committee is legally required to purchase fire insurance for the entire property. In the event of a fire, the management committee will claim compensation from the insurance company on behalf of the owners and use the payout to repair the damaged building structure.

However, note that fire insurance only covers the building itself; personal property such as furniture and appliances inside the home are not covered.

### 🏦 Mortgage Insurance: Protecting Your Repayment Ability

If you purchase an HDB or DBSS flat and use CPF for your mortgage, HPS (Home Protection Scheme) mortgage insurance is mandatory. The coverage starts when you become the legal owner, complete the health declaration, pay the first premium, and complete the loan application. HPS premiums only need to be paid for 90% of the coverage period; for example, for a 10-year coverage, you only pay 9 years of premiums. If you repay your mortgage in cash, HPS is optional. If you have other insurance that fully covers your mortgage (such as term life insurance), you can also apply to opt out of HPS.

For private residences, you can choose MRTA (Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance), which is a decreasing term mortgage insurance. It covers the outstanding mortgage in the event of death or total permanent disability (TPD). The coverage amount decreases as the mortgage balance decreases, so the premium is relatively low. However, MRTA’s coverage structure is fixed—the coverage decreases as the mortgage decreases. In fact, term life insurance can also flexibly cover mortgage risks, and its price has dropped in recent years, making it more cost-effective. Many banks offer MRTA purchase discounts, but it’s recommended to weigh your needs before choosing. (After buying my house, I consulted the bank about MRTA products, and the staff honestly told me that term life was more suitable.)

### 🏚️ Home Insurance: Protection for Personal Property

Fire insurance only covers the building structure. If you want to protect personal assets inside the home, you need to purchase additional home insurance. Home insurance typically covers financial losses caused by fire, flooding, natural disasters, theft, or vandalism, including personal belongings, renovations, appliances, etc. It may also cover temporary accommodation costs, and some products even cover pet-related expenses.

Home insurance is not mandatory; you can choose the appropriate coverage amount and scope based on your family’s actual situation.

### 🌟 Summary

For mandatory fire insurance, it’s important to understand its coverage limitations. Optional home insurance, in my opinion, is similar to accident insurance—it’s not essential, and you can decide whether to buy it and how much coverage you need (usually within 100k). I think the most important thing is that after completing the major event of buying a house, you should review your family’s financial situation and consider whether to increase the life insurance coverage for the main breadwinner to ensure your family’s financial safety net.
